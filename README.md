## üìã Analysis Workflow

1. **Upload Data**: 
   - Select reference genome
   - Upload positive BED file containing ChIP-seq peaks
   - Optionally upload negative BED file or let the system generate negative samples

2. **Process Sequences**:
   - Sequences are extracted from the reference genome based on BED coordinates
   - Data is labeled with positive and negative classes
   - K-mer representation of sequences is generated

3. **Model Training & Evaluation**:
   - XGBoost classifier is trained on k-mer features
   - Model performance is evaluated with metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score
   - Confusion matrix and ROC curve visualizations are provided

4. **Feature Importance Analysis**:
   - Identify the most significant k-mers contributing to classification
   - Visualize importance across different metrics (weight, gain, cover, etc.)
   - Explore the decision tree to understand the classification process
