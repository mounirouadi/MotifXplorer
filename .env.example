# MotifXplorer Configuration

# ==============================================
# DEBUG MODE (for faster Docker builds)
# ==============================================
# Set to 'true' to skip downloading reference genomes during Docker build
# This is useful when you have already copied genome files to backend/reference_genomes/
# Set to 'false' for fresh deployments where genomes need to be downloaded
DEBUG_MODE=false

# ==============================================
# DEPLOYMENT NOTES
# ==============================================
# 
# Server IP: 134.129.255.146
# 
# The application does not need to know the server IP address.
# All API calls use relative paths (/api/*) which automatically
# route through whatever domain/IP you deploy to.
# 
# Your hosting provider will handle:
# - Mapping your domain to port 3000
# - SSL/HTTPS termination
# - Routing HTTPS traffic to the nginx container
# 
# No changes needed in this config for different servers!
